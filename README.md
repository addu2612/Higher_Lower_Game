# Higher_Lower_Game

Description:
The Higher Lower game is a simple yet engaging guessing game typically played on a computer or mobile device. It involves trying to guess which of two options has a higher or lower numerical value. The game often revolves around statistics, trends, or general knowledge.

In a typical version of the game, players are presented with two options (e.g., the number of Google searches for two different terms, or the number of followers on social media accounts). The player must then guess which option has the higher or lower value compared to the other.

Players continue making guesses, and the game provides feedback on whether their guess was correct or not. The objective is to make as many correct guesses in a row as possible.

The Higher Lower game is known for its addictive nature and can be played competitively or casually. It often incorporates real-world data, making it both entertaining and educational.
